Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
FA24SP25Analog_mismatch_test_1	Nominal - 
	intersect(VT("/VOUTN") VT("/VINP")):	Yield	100%
		Min 0.865276	Max 0.92787	Mean 0.89467	Number of errors 0

FA24SP25Analog_mismatch_test_1
	Overall Yield	100%	Number of points passed	500	Total number of points	500

Estimated yield = 100% (500/500), 0 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 100% (500/500)
